          <h1 class="projheader">Summary</h1>
          <p>As an attempt to solve a niche yet important problem, my team of 10 spent 10 weeks designing, developing and perfecting a multi-user mobile application with the main goal of deciding on the placement of almonds at the Central California Almond Growers' Association (CCAGA) distribution center.</p>
          <p>With limited design knowledge and skills as well as a very tight time constraint, our wireframing and prorotyping was mostly low fidelity and rapid as this application was created for a Computer Science course where our work would be judged based on how we performed against test cases we had laid out mid way through the process.</p>

          <h1 class="projheader">Why Almonds?</h1>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-4 col-xs-12 align-self-center justify-content-center">
              <p>With an influx of Almond Growers choosing to send their almonds to be processed at the CCAGA, it is no surprise that the plant has become quite busy. Given that these plants are also extremely large, it is also no surprise that a whiteboard at the entrance to track where inventory is being stored is not effective enough to manage the tons of almonds that come through the front gates or the various people that manage these almonds on their way into the plant and their way out.</p>
              <p>It is because of these challenges and inefficient methods of currently processing almonds at the CCAGA's distribution center that our team set out to create a better, more technologically driven solution in order to automate more of the inner workings of the plant to keep up with the large demand for almonds throughout California. </p>

          <h1 class="projheader">Behind the Scenes</h1>
          <p>Before we could begin crafting a solution, we first had to understand what it was that the CCAGA was responsible for and what operations on a daily basis looked like. After much conversation with our contact inside the plant, we came to the conclusion that the plantâ€™s responsibility is to house the almonds and send them to various different places, but also that the plant is not responsible for shelling, packaging or processing these almonds in any other variety of ways. </p>
          <p>Though the CCAGA handles most Californian almonds, it is only at this beginning point in their lifetime as opposed to the various ending points they may see that they are important to the plant.</p>

          <h1 class="projheader">Planning</h1>
          <p>The main thing we wanted to consider when planning for this application was the potential user base and their needs. It is important whenever we design that we keep the user in mind and oftentimes we assume the user to be more like ourselves than they might actually be.</p>
          <p>In this case, our users varied from Plant Executives to Plant Workers; two very distinct groups of people. We hoped to create different user profiles for each of these categories and take their needs into account when designing the application.</p>
          <p>Similarly, we decided that because our main goal was to maximize efficiency of placements in order to avoid employees wasting time making individual choices, our main focus in creating our application would be creating a simple user interface that had an efficient and effective algorithm for the storage of these almonds.</p>

          <h1 class="projheader">Implementation</h1>
          <p>In order to create this application, we made use of React Native and PostegresQL within a Docker Container</p>
          <p>This application was my first real introduction to front end and showed me that I care a lot more about the way things look and how things flow than I had originally thought I did. It is this project that showed me that design is important and led me to minor in design here at UCSD.</p>

          <h1 class="projheader">Future Plans</h1>
          <p>Though our application has exceeded our MVP, we still hope to stay in contact with the CCAGA as we continue forward and continue to perfect our creation such that they can make use of it for years to come.</p>
          <p>Our application was initially supposed to be used following its creation in June 2020, but due to COVID, the plant has seen a halt in use and has decided not to move forward with the application just yet. We hope that this will change in the near future as COVID cases dwindle down and the CCAGA begins to see in upsurge in almond distribution again. </p>

          <h1 class="projheader">Summary</h1>
          <p>A mobile web application targeted towards college students with the intent of providing recipes in a centralized location to alleviate the stress of finding new recipes for meals - especially for young adults who are trying to make changes from eating out very often. Students need an accessible and informative platform if they want to make serious changes to their diets for the first time. </p>
          <p>As a college student, I often struggle with finding recipes that are feasible for my budget, schedule, and interests as I live a busy lifestyle. This is one of the things I dread most about the week and I often spend lots of time obsessing over what I can make myself to eat in order to avoid all the bad side effects of eating out (for my wallet, health, and schedule). We wanted to create an application that could solve this issue for me and provide the same information for other college students as well in hopes of inspiring a generation of adults well informed about nutrition.</p>

          <h1 class="projheader">Learning about Design</h1>
          <p>In order to begin out process and learn the most about design, we started with needfinding and worked our way up through various low and high fidelity prototypes. Before these prototypes, we did a competitive analysis as outlined below to see what kinds of features would be essential in an application of a similar nature.</p>
          <div class="centeredanalysis">
            <img src="../images/analysis.png" alt="" class="analysis"/>
          </div>
          <p>Made sure to consider the main problem statement and identified needs of the user as we continued along on the project to avoid veering off track. At this point, we were using lofi prototypes as pictured below to represent the user experience we hoped to create</p>
          <div class="centeredprototypes">
            <img src="../images/proto0.png" alt="" class="prototypes"/>
            <img src="../images/proto1.png" alt="" class="prototypes"/>
            <img src="../images/proto2.png" alt="" class="prototypes"/>
            <img src="../images/proto3.png" alt="" class="prototypes"/>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-4 col-xs-12 align-self-center justify-content-center">
              <p class="stupid">Finally, we got to a hi-fi prototype created in Figma and tested this prototype on more users. When building out the application, we made sure to stick as close as possible to the design we had created with Figma making stylistic design changes as we moved forward. </p>

          <h1 class="projheader">Technical Details</h1>
          <p>After the competitive analysis, we performed various evaluations by other designers in order to get a better idea of potential weak spots in our prototypes making use of experience prototypes through interviews as well. Developed the site using html with handlebars express and the web hosting service heroku. </p>

        <div class="section other" data-color=#00A1E4>
          <h1 class="projheader">Takeaways</h1>
          <p>One thing we learned was that the design process is never over! Even though we both designed and developed this application, the phases were not sequential (and they honestly never will be) - we went back to designing many times throughout.</p>
          <p>As my first structured design project, it was much more involved than anticipated</p>
          <p>Structured and well thought out design requires a lot more testing, user research, and iteration than expected</p>

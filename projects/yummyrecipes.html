          <h1 class="projheader">Summary</h1>
          <p>Yummy Recipes is a mobile web application designed for and by college students with the intent of providing recipes in a centralized location to alleviate the stress of finding new recipes for meals! We have found our application to be especially useful for young adults who are trying to minimize the amount of time they spend eating out. Within our needfinding sessions, we found that students need an accessible and informative platform if they want to make serious changes to their diets for the first time. Because of this need, Yummy Recipes was invented.</p>
          <p>Personally, as a college student, I often struggle with finding recipes that are feasible for my budget, schedule, and interests as I live a very busy life. This is one of the things I dread most about the week and I often spend much more time than necessary obsessing over what I can make myself to eat in order to avoid all the consequences of eating out (for my wallet, health, and schedule). My teammate and I wanted to create an application that could solve this issue for us and provide the same information for other college students as well in the hopes of inspiring a generation of adults well informed about nutrition.</p>

          <h1 class="projheader">Learning about Design</h1>
          <p>In order to begin our process, we started with a competitive analysis of food and choice based applications to better understand what types of apps existed to solve the problem we had already identified. While doing so, we also wanted to evaluate how effective these applications were in order to see if there was room to grow in this domain. From our analysis, we found that some of the features that nearly every application had were an easy ramp up, personalized accounts, and the ability to search by ingredient. We also confirmed that there was indeed room to grow in this domain as we found that no one application had hit all of our target features.</p>

          <p>After our analysis, we started on some of our own wireframes to see what kinds of ideas we had. In order to avoid getting too attached to any given one too early in the process, we started with hand drawn figures and moved onto higher fideility techniques as time progressed. Below are figures showing some of the very first wireframes we made!</p>

          </div>
          <p class="stupid">Following the variety of low fidelity wireframes which eventually turned into low fidelity prototypes, we asked various users to test our prototypes and let us know what needed to change in order for the user to have the best possible experience. <i>Some of the main things we noticed were a lack of continuity between button placement as well as an overall dislike of the fleetingness of the yes or no decision on the modeled home page.</i> Before creating a high fidelity prototype, we hit the drawing board again to create a better layout that wouldn't force users to make decisions on a whim and would instead allow more meaningful choices that led to better decisions on our end.</p>
          <p>Pictured below are our final high fidelity wireframes including the changed layout and better placement of buttons.</p>

          <h1 class="projheader">Technical Details</h1>
          <p>Given that the constraints of the project required that we build out our application, this was as far as we took the design process so that we could be able to implement a functional model before the end of the quarter!</p>
          <p>We ended up developing the site using HTML with handlebars and a Node Express web engine. We hosted the site using heroku! If you'd like to check out the final product (although it is not backed up by a functional database but rather a JSON database), you can visit <a href="http://a8-yummy-recipes.herokuapp.com/">this link</a> to see it!</p>
          <p>As the site was built as a mobile application, the intended viewing device is a mobile phone and the application was not intended to be run in a browser.</p>

          <h1 class="projheader">Takeaways</h1>
          <p>The biggest takeaway we had coming out of this project was that the design process is never over! Even though we both designed and developed this application, the phases were not sequential (and they honestly never will be) - we went back to designing many times throughout our development process and were constantly tweaking both smaller and larger scale decisions.</p>
          <p>In the future, we hope to document more of the design process and avoid cutting corners so as to have a showcaseable product at the end of it all. </p>
          <p>Lastly, and possibly most importantly, I realized that structured and well thought out design requires a lot more testing, user research, and iteration than I had initially expected and that although Computer Science is hard in its own respects, the design process can be particularly difficult and especially time consuming if you're as much of a perfectionist as I am.</p>
          <p>Overall, our team had a great time learning about design through this project and loved that we had the ability to build it out to see what briding the gap between designers and programmers is like. We hope to build similar applications in the future to further hone in our skills and create applications that are both well designed and well implemented.</p>
